					As diversity fuels creativity and innovation, we here at
					SpaceLab strongly value the voices and perspectives of those
					underrepresented in the community.
				</p>
				<p>
					One of our goals is to create paid fellowships, internships,
					scholarship opportunities, and debt relief for those who are
					underrepresented, including but not limited to women,
					members of the LGBTQ+ community, and people of color.
					Helping members of the community who struggle economically
					will provide them with the liberty and flexibility necessary
					to explore new career paths in science and technology.{" "}
				</p>
				<p>
					To help us grow these opportunities, please consider making
					a tax-deductible donation to SpaceLab today.
